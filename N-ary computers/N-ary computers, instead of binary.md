As we know, all modern computer tech revolves around storing and processing information encoded as a sequence of characters: 0 and 1.

Imagine if a civilization's computers must use more than 2 symbols. This could be a requirement due to an artifact of some subatomic process that is observed to obtain a ternary value, analogous to how we encode information within electricity: $0V$ represents 0, $5V$ represents 1 (or vice versa) -- there are two options for electricity, either "on" or "off". Harnessing instead, say, the strong force with its 3 colors/types of charge and 8 types of gluons could give such a situation.

Perhaps this civilization's people have constructed massless interceptors between quarks that read and pass on gluon information, and influence some aspect of surrounding gluons and quarks. This all could happen in, say, a neutron. It could then be possible to influence which quark will shoot a gluon or antigluon next.

Anyway. Imagine if an information encoding system were based on a number different from 2. How would that change things?
